00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.290
Welcome to the course for an Introduction
for Data Science Methodology.

2
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.792
This is the beginning of a story
you'll tell others about for years.

3
00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:17.312
Your story won't be in
the form you experience here.

4
00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:21.222
But rather through the stories you'll be
sharing with others as you explain how

5
00:00:21.222 --> 00:00:25.363
your understanding of a question resulted
in an answer that changed house something

6
00:00:25.363 --> 00:00:25.902
was done.

7
00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:30.642
During this course, you'll gain indepth
insights into data science methodologies.

8
00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:34.707
After you complete this course, you'll be
able to describe how data scientists apply

9
00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:37.260
structured approach to
solve business problems.

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.569
And you'll be ready to start creating your
own data science methodology stories.

11
00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:45.849
You'll master the basics of foundational
data science methodology through

12
00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:49.930
instructional videos that incorporate
a real life case study readings,

13
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.108
interactive hands-on labs and
practice assessments.

14
00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:56.214
Where you can practice your skills,
downloadable glossaries for

15
00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:59.385
your reference, and graded assessments
at the end of each lesson.

16
00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:02.686
And the end of the course where
you can validate your knowledge.

17
00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:05.442
Let's take a more detailed
view of the course content.

18
00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.400
In each lesson within each module,

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.406
you'll explore two foundational
data science methodology stages.

20
00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:16.041
In Module 1, Lesson 1, you'll explore
the stages, business understanding and

21
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.422
analytics approach.

22
00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:21.433
In Module 1, Lesson 2, you discover
data scientists work during the data

23
00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:23.906
requirements and data collection stages.

24
00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:27.834
In Module 2, Lesson 1, you'll examine
the work that happens during the data

25
00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30.290
understanding and data preparation stages.

26
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.822
Next, in Module 2, Lesson 2, you'll study
the modeling and evaluation stages.

27
00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:38.966
And finally, in module three, you'll focus
on the deployment and feedback stages.

28
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:43.150
The case study in the course highlights
how to apply data science methodology in

29
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.093
the following real world scenario.

30
00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:49.509
A healthcare facility has a limited budget
to properly address a patient's condition

31
00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.402
before their initial discharge.

32
00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:55.902
The core question is what is the best way
to allocate these funds to maximize their

33
00:01:55.902 --> 00:01:57.720
use to provide quality care?

34
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.574
As you'll see, if the new data
science pilot program is successful,

35
00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:05.952
the facility will deliver better patient
care by giving physicians new tools to

36
00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:10.306
incorporate timely data driven
information into patient care decisions.

37
00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:14.716
When viewing case study information, use
the icons displayed at the top right hand

38
00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:18.507
corner of your screen to help you
differentiate theory from practice.

39
00:02:18.507 --> 00:02:22.909
While participating in the course, if you
encounter challenges or have questions.

40
00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.157
You can find support and

41
00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:28.450
answers and connect with other learners
in the course's discussion forums.

42
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.226
You're ready for this course if have
basic data science knowledge and

43
00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.538
you know how to use Jupyter Notebooks.

44
00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:36.157
And now, welcome to the course.

45
00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:40.251
We look forward to you completing this
course, earning a valuable certificate,

46
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.820
and continuing your path
to a data science career.

47
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.320
