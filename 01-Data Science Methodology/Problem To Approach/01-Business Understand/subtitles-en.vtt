00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.619
Welcome to Data Science Methodology 101 From Problem to Approach Business Understanding!

2
00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.160
Has this ever happened to you?

3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.279
You've been called into a meeting by your boss, who makes you aware of an important

4
00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.610
task one with a very tight deadline that absolutely has to be met.

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.130
You both go back and forth to ensure that all aspects of the task have been considered

6
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.640
and the meeting ends with both of you confident that things are on track.

7
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.660
Later that afternoon, however, after you've spent some time examining the various issues

8
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.120
at play, you realize that you need to ask several additional questions in order to truly

9
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.010
accomplish the task.

10
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.290
Unfortunately, the boss won't be available again until tomorrow morning.

11
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.040
Now, with the tight deadline still ringing in your ears, you start feeling a sense of

12
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
uneasiness.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.201
So, what do you do?

14
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:04.519
Do you risk moving forward or do you stop and seek clarification.

15
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.219
Data science methodology begins with spending the time to seek clarification, to attain

16
00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.520
what can be referred to as a business understanding.

17
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.600
Having this understanding is placed at the beginning of the methodology because getting

18
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.840
clarity around the problem to be solved, allows you to determine which data will be used to

19
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.290
answer the core question.

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.620
Rollins suggests that having a clearly defined question is vital because it ultimately directs

21
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.710
the analytic approach that will be needed to address the question.

22
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.000
All too often, much effort is put into answering what people THINK is the question, and while

23
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.900
the methods used to address that question might be sound, they don't help to solve

24
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.060
the actual problem.

25
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
Establishing a clearly defined question starts with understanding the GOAL of the person

26
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.310
who is asking the question.

27
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.290
For example, if a business owner asks: "How can we reduce the costs of performing an activity?"

28
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.700
We need to understand, is the goal to improve the efficiency of the activity?

29
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.890
Or is it to increase the businesses profitability?

30
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.280
Once the goal is clarified, the next piece of the puzzle is to figure out the objectives

31
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.150
that are in support of the goal.

32
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.530
By breaking down the objectives, structured discussions can take place where priorities

33
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.370
can be identified in a way that can lead to organizing and planning on how to tackle the

34
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.519
problem.

35
00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.409
Depending on the problem, different stakeholders will need to be engaged in the discussion

36
00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.970
to help determine requirements and clarify questions.

37
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.290
So now, let's look at the case study related to applying "Business Understanding"

38
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.319
In the case study, the question being asked is: What is the best way to allocate the limited

39
00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.680
healthcare budget to maximize its use in providing quality care?

40
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.700
This question is one that became a hot topic for an American healthcare insurance provider.

41
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.870
As public funding for readmissions was decreasing, this insurance company was at risk of having

42
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.650
to make up for the cost difference,which could potentially increase rates for its customers.

43
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.419
Knowing that raising insurance rates was not going to be a popular move, the insurance

44
00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:20.159
company sat down with the health care authorities in its region and brought in IBM data scientists

45
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.890
to see how data science could be applied to the question at hand.

46
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.170
Before even starting to collect data, the goals and objectives needed to be defined.

47
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.029
After spending time to determine the goals and objectives, the team prioritized "patient

48
00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.940
readmissions" as an effective area for review.

49
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.390
With the goals and objectives in mind, it was found that approximately 30% of individuals

50
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.730
who finish rehab treatment would be readmitted to a rehab center within one year; and that

51
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.349
50% would be readmitted within five years.

52
00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.839
After reviewing some records, it was discovered that the patients with congestive heart failure

53
00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.700
were at the top of the readmission list.

54
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.639
It was further determined that a decision-tree model could be applied to review this scenario,

55
00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:08.749
to determine why this was occurring.

56
00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:13.209
To gain the business understanding that would guide the analytics team in formulating and

57
00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.829
performing their first project, the IBM Data scientists, proposed and delivered an on-site

58
00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.410
workshop to kick things off.

59
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.960
The key business sponsors involvement throughout the project was critical, in that the sponsor:

60
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.960
Set overall direction

61
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.660
Remained engaged and provided guidance.

62
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.440
Ensured necessary support, where needed.

63
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.800
Finally, four business requirements were identified for whatever model would be built.

64
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
Namely:

65
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.590
Predicting readmission outcomes for those patients with Congestive Heart Failure

66
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.760
Predicting readmission risk.

67
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.100
Understanding the combination of events that led to the predicted outcome

68
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.120
Applying an easy-to-understand process to new patients, regarding their readmission

69
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.620
risk.

70
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.870
This ends the Business Understanding section of this course.

71
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.830
Thanks for watching!
