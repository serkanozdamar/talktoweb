Welcome to Data Science Methodology 101 From problem to approach Analytic Approach!

2
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.109
Selecting the right analytic approach depends on the question being asked.

3
00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.850
The approach involves seeking clarification from the person who is asking the question,

4
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.849
so as to be able to pick the most appropriate path or approach.

5
00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.800
In this video we'll see how the second stage of the data science methodology is applied.

6
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.010
Once the problem to be addressed is defined, the appropriate analytic approach for the

7
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
problem is selected in the context of the business requirements.

8
00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.590
This is the second stage of the data science methodology.

9
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.770
Once a strong understanding of the question is established, the analytic approach can

10
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.190
be selected.

11
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.489
This means identifying what type of patterns will be needed to address the question most

12
00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.420
effectively.

13
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.350
If the question is to determine probabilities of an action, then a predictive model might

14
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.010
be used.

15
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.890
If the question is to show relationships, a descriptive approach maybe be required.

16
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.610
This would be one that would look at clusters of similar activities based on events and

17
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.610
preferences.

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.500
Statistical analysis applies to problems that require counts.

19
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.390
For example if the question requires a yes/ no answer, then a classification approach

20
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.060
to predicting a response would be suitable.

21
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.329
Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without

22
00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.729
being explicitly programmed.

23
00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.920
Machine Learning can be used to identify relationships and trends in data that might otherwise not

24
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.970
be accessible or identified.

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.799
In the case where the question is to learn about human behaviour, then an appropriate

26
00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.530
response would be to use Clustering Association approaches.

27
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.020
So now, let's look at the case study related to applying Analytic Approach.

28
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.990
For the case study, a decision tree classification model was used to identify the combination

29
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.520
of conditions leading to each patient's outcome.

30
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.320
In this approach, examining the variables in each of the nodes along each path to a

31
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.340
leaf, led to a respective threshold value.

32
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.150
This means the decision tree classifier provides both the predicted outcome, as well as the

33
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.510
likelihood of that outcome, based on the proportion at the dominant outcome, yes or no, in each

34
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.379
group.

35
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.959
From this information, the analysts can obtain the readmission risk, or the likelihood of

36
00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.060
a yes for each patient. If the dominant outcome is yes, then the risk

37
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.790
is simply the proportion of yes patients in the leaf.

38
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.810
If it is no, then the risk is 1 minus the proportion of no patients in the leaf.

39
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.709
A decision tree classification model is easy for non-data scientists to understand and

40
00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.970
apply, to score new patients for their risk of readmission.

41
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.560
Clinicians can readily see what conditions are causing a patient to be scored as high-risk

42
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.440
and multiple models can be built and applied at various points during hospital stay.

43
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.550
This gives a moving picture of the patient's risk and how it is evolving with the various

44
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.280
treatments being applied. For these reasons, the decision tree classification

45
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.830
approach was chosen for building the Congestive Heart Failure readmission model.

46
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.300
This ends the Analytic Approach section for this course.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.100
