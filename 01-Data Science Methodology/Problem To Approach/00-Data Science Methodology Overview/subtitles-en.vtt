00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.735
Welcome to data science
methodology overview.

2
00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:11.130
After watching this video,

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.755
you'll be able to describe
the term methodology,

4
00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.080
relate methodology
to data science and

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.855
John Rollins's contributions
to data methodology,

6
00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:22.110
identify the 10 stages of
standard data methodology and

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.340
categorize the questions for

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.830
10 stages of standard
data methodology.

9
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.110
Data science is an
influential domain

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.970
that combined
statistical analysis,

11
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.850
technological expertise,
and domain knowledge

12
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.865
to extract valuable insights
from extensive data sets.

13
00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.070
However, despite the
recent increase in

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.750
computing power and
easier access to data,

15
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.050
we often don't understand

16
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.760
the questions being
asked or know

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.290
how to apply the data correctly

18
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.015
to address the problem at hand.

19
00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.880
Using a methodology helps
resolve those issues.

20
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.545
What is a methodology?

21
00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:53.480
A methodology is a
system of methods

22
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.650
used in a particular
area of study.

23
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.160
A methodology is a
guideline for the decisions

24
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.220
researchers must make during
the scientific process.

25
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.870
In the context of data science,

26
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.550
data science methodology is

27
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.960
a structured
approach that guides

28
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.430
data scientists and solving

29
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.280
complex problems and making
data-driven decisions.

30
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.590
Data science methodology
also includes

31
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.840
data collection forms,
measurement strategies,

32
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.150
and comparisons of
data analysis methods

33
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.180
relative to different research
goals and situations.

34
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.010
Using a methodology provides

35
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.540
the practical guidance needed to

36
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.910
conduct scientific
research efficiently.

37
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.100
There's often a
temptation to bypass

38
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.440
methodology and jump
directly to solutions.

39
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.540
However, jumping to
solutions hinders

40
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.895
our best intentions
for solving problems.

41
00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:36.110
Next, let's explore

42
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.220
methodology as it
relates to data science.

43
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670
The data science
methodology discussed in

44
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
this course is a methodology
outlined by John Rollins,

45
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.085
a seasoned IBM Senior
Data Scientist.

46
00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:47.780
This course is built
on his professional

47
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.220
experience and insights into

48
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.050
the importance of
following a methodology

49
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.210
for successful data
science outcomes.

50
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.055
As a general methodology,

51
00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.840
data science
methodology consists

52
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.355
of the following 10 stages.

53
00:01:58.355 --> 00:02:00.905
Business understanding,
analytic approach,

54
00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:03.035
data requirements,
data collection,

55
00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:05.600
data understanding,
data preparation,

56
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.420
modeling, evaluation,
deployment, and feedback.

57
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.250
Asking questions
is the cornerstone

58
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.735
of success in data science.

59
00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:15.050
Questions drive every stage
of data science methodology.

60
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.510
Data science methodology
aims to answer

61
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.340
the following 10
basic questions which

62
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.680
align with the data
methodology questions.

63
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.870
These first two questions
help you define

64
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.150
the issue and determine
what approach to use.

65
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.500
You'll ask, what is

66
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.240
the problem that you're
trying to solve?

67
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.850
How can you use data to
answer the question?

68
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.620
You'll use the next
four questions to

69
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.405
help you get organized
around the data.

70
00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.345
You'll ask, what data do you
need to answer the question,

71
00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:39.890
where's the data source from,

72
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.405
and how will you
receive the data?

73
00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:42.830
Does the data you collect

74
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.110
represent the problem
to be solved and

75
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.940
what additional
work is required to

76
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.950
manipulate and work
with the data?

77
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.620
Then you'll use these final
four questions to validate

78
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.630
your approach and final
design for ongoing analysis.

79
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.470
You'll ask, when you apply
data visualizations,

80
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.030
do you see answers that
address the business problem?

81
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.490
Does the data model answer

82
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.870
the initial business question

83
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.505
or must you adjust the data?

84
00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:06.515
Can you put the
model into practice?

85
00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:08.855
Can you get constructive
feedback from the data

86
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.435
and the stakeholder to answer
the business question?

87
00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:14.810
In this video, you learned
that data science methodology

88
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.280
guides data scientists in

89
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.350
solving complex
problems with data.

90
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.150
A methodology also includes

91
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.490
data collection forms,
measurement strategies,

92
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.965
and comparisons of
data analysis methods

93
00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:27.950
relative to different research
goals and situations.

94
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.155
As a general science
methodology,

95
00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:33.245
data methodology consists
of the following 10 stages.

96
00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.615
Business understanding,
analytic approach,

97
00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.580
data requirements,
data collection,

98
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.070
data understanding,
data preparation,

99
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.620
modeling, evaluation,
deployment, and feedback.

100
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.060
The 10 questions aligned with

101
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.440
defining the business issue,

102
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.620
determining an approach,
organizing your data,

103
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.180
and validating your approach
for the final data design.
