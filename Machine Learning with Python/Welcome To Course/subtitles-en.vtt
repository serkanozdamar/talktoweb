8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.040
will provide you with a solid foundation in applied
machine learning, paving the way for

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.759
advanced career opportunities in the field of
machine learning, data science, and AI.

10
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:51.599
To gain maximum learning from this course, a
working knowledge of Python, Pandas, NumPy,

11
00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.599
and data preparation and data analysis with Python is recommended.

12
00:00:55.599 --> 00:01:00.279
Familiarity with the field of machine learning will be an added advantage.

13
00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:04.440
In this course, you will become aware of the
role of machine learning in various career

14
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.480
paths.

15
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.400
You will gain a foundational knowledge of the
machine learning lifecycle and how machine

16
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.160
learning models work.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.319
Throughout the course, you will focus on machine learning
modeling techniques such as classification,

18
00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:18.699
regression, and clustering.

19
00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:22.699
Using real-world data, you will learn how these
models fit within the broader supervised

20
00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:25.180
and unsupervised learning frameworks.

21
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.779
You'll also get a brief introduction to advanced
methods such as reinforcement learning, deep

22
00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.059
learning, and the world of artificial intelligence.

23
00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:38.300
You will gain hands-on experience with building,
assessing, and validating various classification,

24
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.180
regression, and clustering machine learning models
using Python and popular open-source

25
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.160
libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.

26
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.839
You will gain a comprehensive understanding of
machine learning using Python through instructional

27
00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:57.040
videos and then practice the concepts learned in hands-on labs.

28
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.319
You will assess your learning with practice and
graded quizzes and strengthen the mastery

29
00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.800
of concepts with reference materials such as a glossary.

30
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.479
A concluding final project in the last module
will provide you with the opportunity to apply

31
00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.460
your knowledge.
